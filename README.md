# E_Commerce_Website
Developed an E-Commerce Website where users can put several items in their cart and once they have the required items in their cart, they can place order for them. Upon placing the order, bill is generated which can be downloaded as a pdf file. There is a separate page for admin to view the orders and set their status to paid, delivered, and pending, etc.
